> zero-dependency API library

This is a work-in-progress, early-stage, zero-dependency library for easily and effectively creating JSON APIs in Node.js. I started this project to challenge myself to write my own implementations of a selection of my favorite features from various packages.

## Routing

Routing is file-based and inferred from the basepath given at the creation of the main API object. It functions the same as the routing in [express-openapi](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/tree/master/packages/express-openapi), which I always found to be the quickest and most workable approach to setting up your API endpoints.
